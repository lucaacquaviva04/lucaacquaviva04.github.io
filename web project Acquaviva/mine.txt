		<h1>Tetris: The Classic Puzzle Game</h1>
			<img src="tetrimini.png" alt="Tetris Logo"/>
			<p>Tetris is a classic puzzle game where you rotate and arrange falling blocks to create solid lines without gaps.</p>
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the arrow keys to move the blocks left and right.</li>
				<li>Use the up arrow key to rotate the blocks.</li>
				<li>Use the down arrow key to speed up the block's descent.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>History</h2>
			<p>Interest in polyominoes in the USSR was sparked by Solomon Golomb's book Polyminoes, published by Mir in 1975 under the title Polymino ("Полимино").</p>

			<p>In particular, pentominoes were so popular that since the 1960s, the magazine Nauka i žizn had a permanent section devoted to the construction of figures with a series of pentominoes, and plastic pentominoes 				were sold in stores.</p>

			<p>At the Computational Center of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, computer scientist Alexei Pažitnov worked on problems of artificial intelligence and speech recognition.</p>

			<p>In his spare time, he used an Elektronika-60 microcomputer to write video games together with colleagues Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov.</p>

			<p>A pentomino enthusiast, he tried to reproduce the puzzle in the form of a video game.</p>

			<p>Since the E-60 had limited processing power and no graphical interface, Pazhitnov used 7 combinations of tetrominoes and ASCII symbols.</p>

			<p>He believed that the game would be unnecessarily complicated with 12 different combinations.</p>

			<p>He showed Pavlovsky and Gerasimov an early version of the game, temporarily called Genetičeskaja inženerija (Russian: "Генетическая инженерия"?, lit. "Genetic Engineering"), where the player had to move and 				stack tetrominoes with the keyboard.</p>

			<p>He then decided to drop them and, noticing that the completed lines quickly filled the screen, decided that they would be eliminated.</p>

			<p>Pazhitnov completed the code on June 6, 1984 after three weeks of work.</p>

			<p>He named it Tetris, a portmanteau of "tetra" ("four") and "tennis," his favorite sport.</p>

			<p>The game ran on an Ė-60 computer connected to a monochrome, alphanumeric screen, with the tetromino squares drawn with two square brackets "[ ]".</p>

			<p>Having learned about Tetris, Pažitnov's colleagues quickly became addicted.</p>

			<p>The game spread throughout the offices of the Academy of Sciences and within weeks reached all Moscow institutions with computers.</p>

			<p>In 1985, following requests to create a version for MS-DOS on the IBM PC computer, which was more widespread and powerful than the Ė-60, Pažitnov commissioned 16-year-old Vadim Gerasimov to rewrite the game in 				Turbo Pascal.</p>

			<p>The program ran in text mode and used colored spaces to represent the tetromino squares.</p>

			<p>The game could also automatically recognize an IBM monochrome card.</p>

			<p>Gerasimov added graphics and a scoreboard.</p>

			<p>Tetris was distributed throughout the USSR on floppy disks through sharing and amateur copying.</p>

			<p>Pazhitnov did not make any money from it, nor did he intend to.</p>
